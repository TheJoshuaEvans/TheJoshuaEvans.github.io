# Joshua Evans

Hello! My name is Joshua Evans, and my website is currently under construction. I develop software. I also have a passion for business and a strong desire to improve my community. I don't have *all* the energy I should have at my age, but I do what I can, and I aim to be the best person I can.

Check out [irisEd.com](https://www.irised.com/), I work there as a Software Developer!

I used to work at [The Engine Company](https://theengine.co/)
